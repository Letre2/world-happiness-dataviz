The World Happiness Report of the United Nations attempts to evaluate the well-being of 150 countries worldwide on the basis of a number of key factors such as social environment, health, GDP, etc. The report is based on the results of a survey. It works with surveys that were evaluated afterwards.

Each country is represented by a flower and a category by a petal. The size of a petal indicates the score of the respective country in this category (e.g. GDP in Germany). When all points are added up, a total score (ladder score) is obtained for each country. The higher the score, the larger the flower.
